# BSControllerOffsets

A collection of Beat Saber controller settings for different headsets and grips.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The offsets here should be used as a guide/template and not as a replacement for making your own settings. Controller settings made by other people won't exactly match up with your own hand position/movement. It is recommended to make your own offsets using EasyOffset.
